I was enjoying playing a game related to procedural dungeon generation at the time so I choose procedural generation for my honours. I worked on it for a few months alongside researching the subject area of procedural generation (specifically cave generation).",

Additionally shown in one of the images was an attempt at using Inverse Kinematics for foot placement, this was also part of the networking.",

These plugins were made for the Garry's Mod game which is an online multiplayer game, most of the plugins included significant networking, UI/UX as well as gameplay design. These plugins were how I started learning to program, I made them all out of my passion for the game and my passion for games programming. Selling these plugins to customers also involved supporting them for customers, these plugins were used by customers and therefore live service, this meant I had to respond to bug fixes and improvements timely. Working with customers/clients provided lots of feedback on my projects, it helped me learn how to make products intended for users and tailor them to a users experience.",
