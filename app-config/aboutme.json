    "about_me_description": "I am a 3rd year Computer Science student at the University of Hull. I have played video games for most of my life and therefore have a very strong passion for them. For the past 5 years I have been working in games development, I started off by working freelance and modding games I love. This turned into me actually working on complex gamemodes and standalone games, I have also spent time looking into and researching 3D graphics myself as well as using game engines such as Unreal/Unity/Godot.",
